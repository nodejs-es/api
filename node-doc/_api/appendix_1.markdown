# Appendix 1 - Third Party Modules

There are many third party modules for Node. At the time of writing, August
2010, the master repository of modules is
[the wiki page](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules).

This appendix is intended as a SMALL guide to new-comers to help them
quickly find what are considered to be quality modules. It is not intended
to be a complete list.  There may be better more complete modules found
elsewhere.
